I have practiced coding in hackerrank for python (https://www.hackerrank.com/chandanaudupaof1) and i have learnt and practiced python for data science in datacamp (https://www.datacamp.com/profile/chandanaudupaofficial)

## Learnings: 
### PYTHON LIBRARY - Numpy

Numpy is used to build n-dimensional array that will be useful to manipulate the data from the dataset to achieve desired outputs/results.
It is also used to find mean, median and standard deviation and many more of the given data.
Some of the popular numpy function are: numpy.array(), numpy.mean(), numpy.std(),numpy.median() etc.

### PYTHON LIBRARY - Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a very powerful library that is used for plotting and data visualization.
With this library, we can plot histograms, scatter and line plots. 
Some of the popular matplotlib functions are: matplotlib.pyplot.plot(), matplotlib.pyplot.scatter(), matplotlib.pyplot.hist(), matplotlib.pyplot.show(), matplotlib.pyplot.xticks(), matplotlib.pyplot.yticks(), matplotlib.pyplot.text() etc.
